Excel Sales &amp; Finance Analytics Project aims for a comprehensive analysis of financial health. Reports like "Customer Net Sales Performance" and "Market Performance vs. Target" leverage advanced Excel techniques, offering nuanced insights for strategic decision-making.
This project tackles the analysis of a vast dataset comprising over half a million records of unorganized sales data, demanding extensive ETL efforts.  Objective is to unearth strategic insights that will empower AtliQ Hardwares to make informed decisions and effectively track key performance indicators (KPIs). The ultimate aim is to drive substantial improvements in the company's performance in the years ahead, centered around net sales and net gross margin.
